# *Illat Kalbī*: The Royal Game of Ur

This package provides code for playing the Early Dynastic Mesopotamian game 𒆜𒆳 𒌨𒂠𒈨𒌍 or *illat kalbī* -- **the pack of dogs**. These days, however, it is known more commonly as *Twenty Squares* or the *[Royal Game of Ur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Game_of_Ur)*. The game’s rules [were discovered and translated by Irving Finkel](https://www.academia.edu/15173145/On_the_Rules_for_the_Royal_Game_of_Ur); the gameplay itself [was solved by Joseph Heled](https://jheled.github.io/royalur/).
